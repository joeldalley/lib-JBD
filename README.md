lib-JBD
=======

The JBD namespace began as a series of very small, no-dependency alternatives or work-alikes to standard tools like File::Slurp.<br/>
Those tools are found at JBD::Core.

The JBD namespace also contains lexing, parsing and grammar tools.<br/>
For JSON tokenizing and parsing, see JBD::JSON.<br/>
For general parsing tools, see JBD::Parser.
