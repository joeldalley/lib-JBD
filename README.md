lib-JBD
=======

The JBD namespace began as a series of very small, no-dependency alternatives or work-alikes to standard tools like [File::Slurp](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurp).

Those tools are found at [JBD::Core](https://metacpan.org/pod/JBD::Core).

Lexing and Parsing Tools
========================

For general parsing tools, see [JBD::Parser](https://metacpan.org/pod/JBD::Parser).<br/>
For JSON tokenizing and parsing, see [JBD::JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JBD::JSON).
