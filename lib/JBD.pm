=head1 SYNOPSIS

The JBD namespace began as a series of very small, no-dependency alternatives or work-alikes to standard tools like L<File::Slurp>. Those tools are found at L<JBD::Core>.

The JBD namespace also contains lexing, parsing and grammar tools.

For JSON tokenizing and parsing, see L<JBD::JSON>.

For general parsing tools, see L<JBD::Parser>.
